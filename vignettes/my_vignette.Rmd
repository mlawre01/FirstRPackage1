## Description

This R package was built for the STAT547 course at UBC as an exercise to learn about package development. Normally, this file would explain to the user what the package contains and its intended use followed by some examples. 


## Logarithmic and exponentials 

Recall the relationship between logarithmic and exponential functions:

> $$y = b^x$$ 
$$log_b(y) = x$$


## Details

This package contains the following functions: 

  - **cube** 

> $$y = b^3$$

  - **log_10**
  
> $$x = log_{10}(y)$$
  

## Examples

```{r}
library(powers)
```

```{r}
cube(7)
log_10(8)
```
